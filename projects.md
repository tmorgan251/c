# Intro
This file simply is here to roadmap CLI projects that I plan to create in C before moving to another programming language most likely zig.
These projects are meant to be broken up into beginner, intermediate, and advanced level projects. 

## Beginner Projects
Text grep - simple version of grep that searches for strings in a file


## Intermediate Projects
File backup Tool - copy/sync directories with timestamps
Log analyzer - parse log files and exract statistics from them

## Advanced Projects
HTTP Client - fetch URLs and handle reponses
